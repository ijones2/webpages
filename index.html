    <p>I'm Ivy Jones and I am from <em>Durham</em>, North Carolina. My major is Civil Engineering and Paper science and I am a first year at NC State. I chose civil engineering and paper science 
	because I wanted to create sustainble solutions to issues such as creating bridges and water systems that will last 
	long and create paper mills that will <strong>not</strong> negatively impact the environment. 
	</p>    
	<br />
	<br />
	<p> I do <ins>not</ins> have a current job, but I had an internship over the summer at an engineeering company
	where I fell in love with civil engineering. I do not know what my dream job
	is. I just want to be happy in whatever I do. I'm very much interested in everything, 
	so I think I will be happy anywhere I go.
